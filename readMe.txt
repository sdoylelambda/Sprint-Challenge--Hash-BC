Interview Questions MARCH 13

Explain in detail the workings of a dynamic array:


    A DYNAMIC ARRAY HAS ONE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE, IT AUTOMATICALLY RE-SIZES AS NEEDED. THIS GIVES DYNAMIC ARRAYS A
    INSERT RUNTIME WORSE CASE OF O(N) AND LOOKUP IS CONSTANT TIME



What is the runtime complexity to access an array, add or remove from the front, and add or remove from the back?

I ASSUME THIS IS RUNTIME COMPLEXITY FOR A HASH TABLE, IF SO ALL ARE BEST CASE 0(1) OR CONSTANT TIME,
THE FASTEST AVAILABLE RUN TIMES.
    RUNTIME
    ACCESS ARRAY:
    ADD OR REMOVE FRONT:
    ADD OR REMOVE BACK:




What is the worse case scenario if you try to extend the storage size of a dynamic array?

O(N)



Explain how a blockchain is structured. What are the blocks, what is the chain? How is the data organized?

BLOCKCHAIN IS STRUCTURED WITH BLOCKS WITH ENCRYPTED KEY'S AND VERIFIES BY CHECKING THE PREVIOUS BLOCK'S KEY.
THE BLOCKS ARE ENCRYPTED BY BEING HASHED AND BEGIN WITH A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF ZEROS.


Explain how proof of work functions. How does it operate. How does this protect the chain from attack.
What kind of attack is possible?

A PROOF OF WORK FUNCTION OPERATES BY SLOWING DOWN A COMPUTER BY GIVING AT A COMPLEX YET SIMPLE TO VERIFY PROBLEM.
FOR BLOCKCHAIN THIS GIVES TIME FOR THE NEXT BLOCK TO BE MINED AND THEN THE HACKER WOULD HAVE TO HACK THE HASH
BEFORE THE NEXT BLOCK IS MINED OR IF IT IS MINED ALSO HACK THAT ONE AND SO ON DOWN THE LINE UNTIL THE END.
